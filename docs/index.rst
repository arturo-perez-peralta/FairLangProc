FairLangProc documentation
==========================

The Fair Language Processing package is a extensible open-source Python library containing techniques developed by the
research community to help detect and mitigate bias in Natural Language Processing throughout the AI application lifecycle.

The FairLangProc package includes:
1. Data sets to test for biases in NLP models.
2. Metrics based on different philosophies to quantified said biases. 
3. Algorithms to mitigate biases.
It has been created with the intention of encouraging the use of bias mitigation strategies in the NLP community, and with the hope of democratizing these tools for the ever-increasing set of NLP practitioners. We invite you to use it and improve it.

The companion paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the concepts and capabilities, with all code available in [notebooks](./notebooks).

We have developed the package with extensibility in mind. This library is still in development. We encourage your contributions.
